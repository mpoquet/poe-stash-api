# poe-stash-api
Simple Python code to retrieve Path of Exile stash information from GGG's API.

## Install

`pip install .`

## Usage
Give a look to the `examples` directory.

## Maintenance status
This code has no special ambition. It started as an example to fetch GGG API and I added a prototype to price stackable items.

I am interested in keeping this code in a working state for the basic stuff that is already implemented.

As the code is not tested under CI, something may go wrong if you try to use an existing example while GGG's API changed.
Please open an issue in this case.
